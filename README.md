## Kitty Cat Club üêæ

This is a basic web page built with React components, showcasing images of my four beloved cats: Charlie, Ruby, Bagel, and Cece. This project was created for the Components assignment in the Introduction to React course (SD-260) at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology.

### Project Features
- Basic React Components: Utilizes fundamental React components such as Header, Banner, Button, Gallery, and Footer to structure the webpage.
- Image Gallery: Displays a row of four images featuring Charlie, Ruby, Bagel, and Cece, dynamically rendered using the `map` method.
- Button Styling via Props: The Banner component sets the text and styles of buttons (primary and secondary) through props, demonstrating component communication.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages: The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, indicating a static deployment of the React application.
